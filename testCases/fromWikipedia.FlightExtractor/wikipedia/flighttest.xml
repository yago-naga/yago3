'''Amsterdam Airport Schiphol''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|ʃ|ɪ|p|ɒ|l}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/language/wordsinthenews/2009/02/090225_witn_plane_crash.shtml |title=Words in the news – Turkish plane crashes in Holland |author=Ben Shore |date=17 april 2009 |work=BBC Learning English |publisher=BBC |at=Click &quot;listen&quot; to hear the report |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{lang-nl|Luchthaven Schiphol}}, {{IPA-nl|ˈlʏxtˌɦaːvə(n) ˈsxɪpɦɔl}}) {{Airport codes|AMS|EHAM}} is the [[Netherlands]]' main [[international airport]], located 20 minutes ({{convert|4.9|NM|abbr=on|lk=in}}&lt;ref name=&quot;AIP&quot;/&gt;) southwest of [[Amsterdam]], in the [[municipality]] of [[Haarlemmermeer]]. The airport's official English name, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, reflects the original Dutch word order (''Luchthaven Schiphol''). The airport used to have the [[IATA]] code of SPL, which has fallen into disuse and has been replaced by AMS. The airport is the primary hub for [[KLM]], [[Martinair]], [[Transavia]] and [[Arkefly]]. The airport also serves as a European hub for [[Delta Air Lines]]. It is considered to be an [[Airport City]].

==Description==
[[File:KLM Aircraft at Schiphol.jpg|thumb|left|KLM and [[Northwest Airlines]] fleet at Schiphol]]
Schiphol is an important [[Europe]]an airport, ranking as Europe’s [[List of the busiest airports in Europe|5th busiest]] and the world's [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|15th busiest]] by total passenger traffic. It also ranks as the world’s 6th busiest by international passenger traffic&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aci.aero/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&amp;cp=1-5-212-1376-1380_666_2__ Airports Council International - International Passenger Traffic for past 12 months]&lt;/ref&gt; and the world’s [[World's busiest airports by cargo traffic|17th largest for cargo tonnage]].

45.3 million passengers passed through the airport in 2010, a 4% increase compared with 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schiphol.nl/SchipholGroup1/NieuwsPers/Persbericht/RecoveryOfAviationSectorContinues.htm Recovery of aviation sector continues - Schiphol Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schiphol's main competitors in terms of [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|passenger traffic]] and [[World's busiest airports by cargo traffic|cargo throughput]] are [[London Heathrow Airport]], [[Frankfurt Airport]], [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport]] and [[Madrid-Barajas Airport]].

In 2009, around 67% of passengers using the airport flew to and from Europe, 12% to and from North America and around 9% to and from Asia; cargo volume was mainly between Schiphol and Asia (45%) and North America (16%).&lt;ref name=Annual2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schiphol.nl/SchipholGroup/InvestorRelations/FinancialInformation/AnnualReports.htm|title=Annual Report Schiphol Group 2009|publisher=Schipholgroup|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 direct passenger flights were operated to 265 destinations, with a further 19 freighter-only routes.&lt;ref name=Annual2009/&gt; The airport is one out of nine airports in the world to have a rating of 4 stars in [[Skytrax]]'s grading system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Airport Star Ranking - 4 Star Airports|publisher = Skytrax|year= 2011|url = http://www.airlinequality.com/AirportRanking/4-Star.htm|accessdate = 2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schiphol has six [[runway]]s, one of which is used mainly by [[general aviation]] aircraft. The northern end of the Polderbaan, the name of last runway to be constructed, is 7&amp;nbsp;km north of the control tower, causing lengthy taxi times (up to 20 min) to the terminal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/schiphol/schiphol2.html Airport Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; Plans have been made for a seventh runway.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The airport is built as one large terminal, split into three large departure halls, which converge again once airside. The most recent of these was completed in 1994, and expanded in 2007 with a new part, named Terminal 4, although this part is not recognised as a separate building. Plans for further terminal expansion exist, including the construction of a separate new terminal between the Zwanenburgbaan and Polderbaan runways that would end the one-terminal concept.

Because of intense traffic and high landing fees, some [[low cost carrier]]s decided to move their flights to smaller airports, such as [[Rotterdam The Hague Airport]] and [[Eindhoven Airport]]. Many low cost carriers (like [[EasyJet]] or [[Bmibaby]]) continue to operate from Schiphol, using the low-cost H-pier.

Schiphol is the home base of [[Arkefly]], [[Corendon Dutch Airlines]], [[KLM]] (Royal Dutch Airlines), [[Martinair]] and [[Transavia.com|Transavia]]. Schiphol was the home base of [[Amsterdam Airlines]], which ceased operations on 31 October 2011

The Schiphol [[Air traffic control tower]], with a height of {{convert|101|m|ft}}, was the tallest in the world when constructed in 1991.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} Schiphol is geographically one of the world's lowest major commercial airports. The entire airport is below sea level; the lowest point sits at {{convert|11|ft|m}} below sea level (or {{convert|4.5|ft|m}} below the Dutch [[Normaal Amsterdams Peil]] (NAP)); the runways are around {{convert|3|m|ft}} below NAP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holland.com/water/nl/index.html?page=http://www.holland.com/water/nl/bouwen/nap/wnapfeit.html Tourist Information on buildings and water management]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahn.nl/ Algemeen Hoogtebestand Nederlands, official elevation map by the Ministry of Water and Transport]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schiphol is equipped with 18 double [[jetway]] gates in preparation for airlines introducing the [[Airbus A380]]; to date, none have. [[Malaysian Airlines]] is expected to do so in 2012.

==Infrastructure==
[[File:Schiphol-overview.png|thumb|Map showing the six runways of Schiphol.]]
[[File:Rijks Museum, Schipol Airport, Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to the airport's Rijksmuseum]]
Schiphol has large [[shopping mall|shopping areas]] as a source of revenue and as an additional attraction for passengers. Schiphol Plaza is the shopping centre before customs, hence it is used by air travelers and non-traveling visitors.

The [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Rijksmuseum]] operates an annex at the airport, offering a small overview of both classical and contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/tentoonstellingen/schiphol?lang=en Rijksmuseum Amsterdam Schiphol]&lt;/ref&gt; Admission to the exhibits is free.

In summer 2010, the world's first permanent airport library opened alongside the museum, providing passengers access to a collection of 1,200 books (translated into 29 languages) by Dutch authors or on subjects relating to the country’s history and culture. The {{convert|968|sqft|m2|adj=on}} library offers e-books and music by Dutch artists and composers that can be downloaded free of charge to a laptop or mobile device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/arts/16iht-library.html | work=The New York Times | first=Nicola | last=Clark | title=At Schiphol, an Unlikely Sanctuary of Books | date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schiphol has its own [[mortuary]], where the dead can be handled and kept before departure or after arrival. Since October 2006, people can also get married at Schiphol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/travel/columnist/baskas/2008-06-10-airport-weddings_N.htm Will you marry me at the airport?]&lt;/ref&gt;

For aviation enthusiasts, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol has a large rooftop viewing area, called the Panoramaterras. It is not accessible to connecting passengers unless they first exit the airport. Enthusiasts and the public can enter, free of charge, from the airport's landside. Since June 2011, it is the location for a [[KLM Cityhopper]] [[Fokker 100]], modified to be a viewing exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schiphol.nl/Reizigers/Nieuws/Fokker100VanKLMOpPanoramaterrasSchiphol.htm |title=Fokker 100 van KLM op Panoramaterras Schiphol |date=2011-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the Panoramaterras, Schiphol has other spotting sites, especially along the newest Polderbaan runway and at the [[McDonald's]] restaurant at the north side of the airport.

The wayfinding signage at Schiphol was designed in 1991 by [[Paul Mijksenaar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mijksenaar.com/projects-quicktour/16-amsterdam_airport_schiphol.html |title=Amsterdam Airport Schipol |date=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Martinair Convair 440.jpg|thumb|The apron in 1965]]
Schiphol opened on 16 September 1916 as a military airbase, consisting of a few barracks and a field serving as both platform and runways. When civil aircraft started to make use of the field (17 December 1920), it was often called ''Schiphol-les-bains''. The [[Fokker]] aircraft manufacturer started a factory near Schiphol airport in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.warandgame.info/2007/11/fokker-aircraft-company-1910-45.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Schiphol's name is derived from a former fortification named ''Fort Schiphol'' which was part of the [[Stelling van Amsterdam]] defence works.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.stelling-amsterdam.org/forten/schiphol/info.htm#FOTO Stelling van Amsterdam - Fort van het Schiphol]&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1852, the [[Haarlemmermeer]] [[polder]] in which the airport lies was a large lake, in the shallow waters of which sudden violent storms could claim many ships. This was the main reason for reclaiming it. In English, Schiphol translates to 'Ship Grave', a reference to the number of ships lost in the area.

Schiphol uses a ''one terminal'' concept, where all facilities are located under a single roof, fanning off the central 'plaza'. The areas, though, are divided into three sections or halls: 1, 2 and 3. To all of these halls, piers or concourses are connected. However, it is possible, on both sides of security or customs, to walk from one pier to another, even if they are connected to different halls. The exception to this is the low-cost pier M: once airside (i.e. past security), passengers cannot go to any of the other halls or piers. Immigration control separates [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] from non-[[Schengen Area]]s.
Schiphol Airport has approximately 165 boarding gates available.

;Departure Hall 1
*Consists of Piers B and C - both of which are dedicated Schengen areas.
;Departure Hall 2
*Consists of Piers D and E.
**Pier D is the largest pier and has two floor levels. The lower floor is used for non-Schengen flights, the upper floor is used for Schengen flights. By using stairs, the same jetways are used to access the aircraft. Schengen gates are numbered D-60 and up, non-Schengen gates are numbered from D-1 to D-59.
**Pier E is a dedicated non-Schengen area.
;Departure Hall 3
*Consists of F, G, H and M.
**Piers F, G and H are non-Schengen areas.
**Piers M is a dedicated Schengen area.
**Piers H and M are the low-cost piers.

'''Note''': The airlines and destinations listed are not definite since very few airlines have a dedicated pier or gates; the piers listed below are based on regularity.

==Accidents and incidents==
[[File:Bijlmerramp2 without link.jpg|thumb|The crash site of [[El Al Flight 1862]] in 1992]]
[[File:Crash Turkish Airlines TK 1951 complete site.jpg|thumb|The crash site of [[Turkish Airlines Flight 1951]] on 25 February 2009]]
*14 November 1946, a [[C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47]] operated by KLM from London approached Schiphol during bad weather conditions. The first two attempts to land failed. During the third attempt, the pilot realized that the airplane was not lined up properly with the runway. A sharp left turn was made at low speed, causing the left wing to hit the ground. The airplane crashed and caught fire, killing all 26 people on board, including the plane's crew of five.
*4 October 1992, [[El Al Flight 1862]], a [[Boeing 747]] cargo airplane heading to [[Tel Aviv]], suffered physical engine separation of both right-wing engines (#3 and #4) just after taking off from Schiphol and crashed into an apartment building in the [[Bijlmer]] neighbourhood of Amsterdam while attempting to return to the airport. A total of 43 people were killed, including the plane's crew of three and a &quot;[[Nonrev|non revenue passenger]]&quot;. Several others were injured.
*4 April 1994, [[KLM Cityhopper Flight 433‎|Flight KL433]] to [[Cardiff]], a [[Saab 340]] operated by [[KLM Cityhopper]], returned to Schiphol after setting the number two engine to flight idle because the crew mistakenly believed that the engine suffered from low oil pressure because of a faulty warning light. On final approach at a height of {{convert|90|ft|m}}, the captain decided to [[go-around]] and gave full throttle on only the number one engine leaving the other in flight idle. The airplane rolled to the right, pitched up, stalled and hit the ground at 80 degrees bank. Of the twenty-four people on board, three were killed including the captain. Nine others were seriously injured.
*25 February 2005, a diamond robbery occurred at Schipol's cargo terminal, the robbers using a stolen KLM van to gain [[airside]] access. The estimated value of the stones was around 75 million [[euro]]s, making it the largest diamond robbery ever recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Rachael Bell for tru TV, [http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/outlaws/major_heists/3.html Sensation Heists - Amsterdam's Million-Dollar Airport Heist]. Article retrieved 26 November, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
*27 October 2005, a fire broke out at the airport's detention centre, killing 11 people and injuring 15. The complex was holding 350 people at the time of the incident. Results from the investigation almost one year later showed that fire safety precautions were not in force. A national outrage resulted in the resignation of Justice Minister [[Piet Hein Donner|Donner]] ([[Christen Democratisch Appèl|CDA]]) and Mayor Hartog of Haarlemmermeer. Spatial Planning Minister [[Sybilla Dekker|Dekker]] ([[VVD]]) resigned as well, because she bore responsibility for the construction, safety, and maintenance of state-owned buildings.
*25 February 2009, [[Turkish Airlines Flight 1951]], a [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-800]] from Istanbul crashed on approach to the airport's Polderbaan, just 1&amp;nbsp;km short of the runway. The plane carried 128 passengers and 7 crew on board. 9 people were killed and a further 86 were injured, including six with serious injuries. An initial report from the [[Dutch Safety Board]] revealed that the left [[radio altimeter]] had failed to provide the correct height above the ground and suddenly reported -8 feet. As a cause of this the [[autothrottle]] system closed the thrust levers to idle, as it is programmed to reduce thrust when below {{convert|27|ft|m}} radio altitude. This eventually resulted in a dropping airspeed which was not acted upon until it was too late to recover and the aircraft [[Stall (flight)|stalled]] and crashed in a field.
*25 December 2009, [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]], an [[Islamic]] [[terrorist]] from [[Nigeria]], set off an explosive device on [[Northwest Airlines Flight 253]], an [[Airbus A330]] from Schiphol as the plane was landing at [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]] in [[Romulus, Michigan|Romulus]], Michigan. The device failed to go off correctly, and the suspect suffered burns to his lower body. Three other passengers had minor injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34592031/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts Officials: Possible terror attack on Northwest jet]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 13 January 2010, an [[Arkefly]] Boeing 767-300 PH-AHQ operating flight OR361 from Amsterdam Airport Schiphol to [[Aruba Airport]] declared an emergency after a man who claimed to have a bomb on board began a struggle with the flight crew, the aircraft made an emergency landing at [[Shannon Airport]].  [[Gardai]] stormed the plane and arrested the man, where he was taken to Shannon Garda station.  A passenger who had surgery the previous month collapsed in the terminal while waiting for the continuation of the flight and had to be taken to a local hospital. A replacement aircraft, also a Boeing 767-300, continued the flight to [[Aruba]].
*2 March 2010, a [[Corendon Airlines]] pilot, of [[Sweden|Swedish]] origin, was arrested at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol after flying commercial jets for 13 years without a licence. He was due to fly a [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-400]] to [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]] with 101 passengers on board when the [[Dutch police]] arrested him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8549954.stm 'Fake pilot' arrested moments before take-off ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/25330/20100303/ Swedish pilot flew 13 years without licence]&lt;/ref&gt; A back-up pilot was standing by to fly the jet to its destination. It is reported that he had clocked up to 10,000 hours flying passenger jets for various European airlines  and 2 years with Corendon Airlines before the tip off from [[Sweden|Swedish]] authorities. The licence he held was to fly light aircraft, but that licence expired 13 years before the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://panorama.am/en/society/2010/03/04/pilot/ Swedish pilot flew without licence for 13 years]&lt;/ref&gt;
*2 October 2010, a [[Corendon Airlines]] [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-400]] landed in bad weather on the short (2014 metre) Oostbaan (04/22) and the plane overshot the runway resulting in the nosewheel landing in the mud at the end of the runway. According to the airline, this runway should not have been used in heavy rain.&lt;ref name=&quot;corendonoost&quot;/&gt;

'''Frankfurt am Main Airport''' {{Airport codes|FRA|EDDF}}, or simply '''Frankfurt Airport''', known in [[German language|German]] as ''Flughafen Frankfurt am Main'' or ''Rhein-Main-Flughafen'',  is a major [[international airport]] located in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} southwest of the [[Central business district|city centre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AIP&quot;/&gt; 

Run by transport company [[Fraport]], Frankfurt Airport is by far the busiest airport by passenger traffic in Germany, the [[List of the busiest airports in Europe|third busiest in Europe]] (after [[London Heathrow Airport]] and [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport]]) and the [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|ninth busiest worldwide]] in 2010. Passenger traffic at Frankfurt Airport in 2010 was 53.0 million. As of summer 2011, Frankfurt Airport serves the most international destinations in the world, serving 298 destinations in 110 countries&lt;ref name=&quot;FRAPORT&quot;&gt;http://www.fraport.com/content/fraport-ag/en/press_center/news_releases/frankfurt_airportsummertimetable2011moreflightsandsubstantiallym.html&lt;/ref&gt; and is the [[World's busiest airports by cargo traffic|second busiest airport in Europe by cargo traffic]]. The southern side of the airport ground was home to the [[Rhein-Main Air Base]], which was a major [[air base]] for the [[United States]] from 1947 until 2005, when the air base was closed and the property was acquired by Fraport.

The airport is centrally located in the [[Frankfurt/Rhine-Main|Frankfurt/Rhine-Main region]], Germany's [[metropolitan regions in Germany|second-largest metropolitan region]], which itself has a central location in the densely populated region of the [[Blue Banana|west-central European megalopolis]]. Thereby, along with a strong [[Frankfurt Airport long-distance station|rail]] and [[German Autobahnen|motorway]] connection, the airport serves as a major transportation hub to the greater region, less than two hours by ground to [[Cologne]], the [[Ruhr Area]], and [[Stuttgart]].

Frankfurt Airport is the main [[airline hub|hub]] of [[Lufthansa]], Germany's [[flag carrier]], and of [[Condor Flugdienst]]. Due to capacity constraints in Frankfurt, Lufthansa has established a secondary hub at [[Munich Airport]], where many key medium and long-haul routes are available.

The airport is currently ranked as a four-star by [[Skytrax]] along with eight other airports around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airlinequality.com/AirportRanking/4-Star.htm Skytrax - The World's 4-Star Airports]&lt;/ref&gt;

The airport has been expanded several times since its opening in 1936 and now has two large terminals (Terminal 1 and Terminal 2), with a capacity of approximately 58 million passengers yearly, and four runways. In recent years, major construction works were necessary to make the airport compatible for the [[Airbus A380]], including a large A380 maintenance facility, because Lufthansa has stationed its A380 aircraft fleet at Frankfurt Airport. On October 20, 2011, the fourth runway went into operation, which will allow the airport to meet the predicted demand of about 700,000 aircraft movements in 2020. To handle the predicted passenger amount of about 90 million in 2020, Fraport currently builds a new terminal section at Terminal 1 for additional six million passengers and a large Terminal 3 for 25 million passengers is scheduled to be built beginning in 2013.

== History ==
=== First Airport ===
On November 16, 1909, the [[List of airlines by foundation date|world's first airline]] was founded in Frankfurt: The ''Deutsche Luftschiffahrts-Aktiengesellschaft'' ([[DELAG]]). DELAG then built the first airport in Frankfurt, called ''Airship Base at Rebstock'', which was located in [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] in the western part of the city and was primarily used for [[airship]]s in the beginning. It opened in 1912 and was extended after [[World War I]], but in 1924 an expert's report already questioned the possibility of further expansions at this location. With the foundation of [[Lufthansa]] in 1926 a rapid boom of civilian air travel started and soon the airship base became too small to handle the demand. Plans for a new and larger airport located in the [[Frankfurt City Forest]] south-west of [[Schwanheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Schwanheim]] were approved in 1930, but were not realized due to the [[Great Depression]]. After the so-called „[[Machtergreifung]]“ in 1933 the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] revived the plans and started the construction of the new airport.

=== Second Airport ===
[[File:Hindenburg at lakehurst.jpg|thumb|LZ 129 Hindenburg at Lakehurst]]
[[File:Berlinairlift-rm.jpg|thumb|Rhein-Main Air Base during the Berlin Airlift]]
The ''Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport and Airship Base'' was officially opened on July 8, 1936. In the following years it became the second-largest airport in Germany (after [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]]) and was home for the two largest German [[Zeppelin]]s, [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin]] and [[LZ 129 Hindenburg]]. It was planned to make Frankfurt the most important destination for Zeppelins in Germany, but after the [[Hindenburg disaster|catastrophic crash of the Hindenburg]] in Lakehurst on May 6, 1937, the airship era came to an abrupt end.

'''World War II'''

After the beginning of [[World War II]] in 1939 all foreign [[airline]]s left the airport and control of air traffic was transferred to [[History of the Luftwaffe (1933-1945)|German Luftwaffe]]. On May 9, 1940, the first [[bomber]]s took-off to attack [[France]]. From August to November 1944 a [[concentration camp]] was established in [[Mörfelden-Walldorf|Walldorf]], close to the airport ground, where Jewish female prisoners were forced to work for the airport. The [[Allies of World War II]] destroyed the runway system with [[airstrike]]s in 1944 and the [[Wehrmacht]] blew up buildings and fuel depots in 1945, shortly before the [[US Army]] took control of the airport on March 25, 1945. After the [[German Instrument of Surrender]] the war in Europe ended and the US Army started to build a new temporary runway at Frankfurt Airport. The southern part of the airport ground was occupied to build the [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] as an [[Air Force Base]] for the [[United States Air Forces in Europe]].

'''Berlin Airlift'''

In 1948 the [[Soviet Union]] blocked the Western Allies' railway and road access to the sectors of [[West Berlin]] under Allied control. Their aim was to force the western powers to allow the Soviet zone to start supplying Berlin with food and fuel, thereby giving the Soviets practical control over the entire city. In response, the Western Allies organized the [[Berlin Airlift]] to carry supplies via air to the people in West Berlin. The airports in Frankfurt, [[Hamburg Airport|Hamburg]] and [[Hannover Airport|Hannover]] were the primary bases for the allied airplanes. The heavy use of these so-called „[[Raisin Bombers]]“ caused damages to the runway in Frankfurt and forced the US Army to build a second parallel runway. The airlift ended in September 1949 after the Soviet Union had ended their blockade.

'''Airport growth'''

In 1951 restrictions for German air travellers were lifted and the civil air traffic started to grow again: In 1952 Frankfurt Airport handled more than 400.000 passengers, a year later it was more than half a million. About 100 to 120 planes started and landed in Frankfurt per day. In 1955 Lufthansa finally recommenced their flights to and from Frankfurt and in the same year the Federal Republic of Germany gained their [[air sovereignty]] back from the Allies. In 1957 the northern runway was extended, first to 3.000 meters, then up to 3.900 meters, to make it compatible for [[jet aircraft]]s. 

The airport did not emerge as a major international [[airline hub]] until 1958 when a new passenger terminal called ''Empfangsanlage Ost'' (Terminal East, literally: „Arrival Facility East“) opened in the north-east corner of the airport ground. Only four years later it was clear that the terminal was yet too small for the demand: In 1961 Frankfurt already had 2.2 million passengers and 81.000 starts and landings, making it the second busiest airport in Europe behind [[London Heathrow Airport]].

In 1962 it was decided to build an even larger terminal with a capacity for 30 million passengers per year. The works on this terminal began in 1965. The southern runway was extended to 3.750 meters in 1964. In 1970 a new airplane hangar was inaugurated: It accommodated for six jet airplanes and was the world's largest airplane hangar by that time.

'''Terminal Mitte'''

[[File:Information Panel, Terminal 1 at Frankfurt Airport.jpg|thumb|Information panel at Terminal 1]]
The new terminal, called ''Terminal Mitte'' (Central Terminal), today known as ''Terminal 1'', divided into three concourses (A, B and C) with 56 gates, and an electric operated [[baggage handling system]], was opened to the public on March 14, 1972. It was assumed that the terminal capacity would be sufficient for nearly 30 years to come. Along with the new terminal a train station (Frankfurt Airport station) opened at the airport, which was the first airport train station in the Federal Republic of Germany. A few days later the old ''Empfangsanlage Ost'' was closed.

'''Third runway'''

Planning for a third runway (called ''Startbahn 18 West'') began in 1973. This project spawned massive protests by residents and environmentalists. The main points of conflict were increasing noises and pollution and the cutting down of protected trees in the [[Frankfurt City Forest]]. While the protests and related lawsuits were unsuccessful in preventing the construction of the runway, the ''Startbahn West'' protests were one of the major crystallization points for the German [[environmental movement]] of the 1980s. The protests even continued after the runway had been opened in 1984 and in 1987 two police officers were killed by a gunman. This incident ended the ''Startbahn West'' protests for good. Because of its location in north-south-direction, in contrast to the other two runways in east-west-direction, the use of the third runway is limited: The Startbahn West can only be used for [[takeoff]]s in the southward direction because otherwise it would interfere with the air traffic at the other runways. Due to this restriction the runway must be partially or fully closed in case the northward wind componend gets too strong.

'''Terminal 2'''
[[File:AirportFrankfurt terminal2.jpg|thumb|Terminal 2 (November 2004)]]
In 1990 the works on a new terminal (''Terminal 2'') began because it was foreseeable that ''Terminal Mitte'' would reach its capacity limit sooner than expected. The new terminal, divided into concourses D and E, was built in the east of the existing terminal where once the ''Empfangsanlage Ost'' had been. With the opening in 1994 Frankfurt Airport had pushed up its terminal capacity to 54 million passengers per year. Along with the terminal opening, a [[people mover]] system called ''Sky Line'' was established to provide a fast connection between ''Terminal 2'' and ''Terminal Mitte'' (now renamed ''Terminal 1'').

'''Second train station'''

In 1999 a second train station, primarily for [[InterCityExpress]] long-distance trains (called [[Frankfurt Airport long-distance station]]), opened near Terminal 1 as part of the new [[Cologne–Frankfurt high-speed rail line]]. At the same time local and regional trains were centered at the existing underground train station, now renamed [[Frankfurt Airport Regional station]].

'''Closing of the Rhein-Main Air Base'''

On December 31, 2005, the [[Rhein-Main Air Base]] in the southern part of the airport ground was closed and the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] moved to [[Ramstein Air Base]]. The property was handed back to Fraport which allows the airport to use it to build a new passenger terminal. The property of the housing area for the soldiers, called ''Gateway Gardens'', which was located north-east of the airport ground, was given back to the city of Frankfurt in the same year and will be developed as a business district in the following years.

'''Airbus A380'''
[[File:2010-07-21 A380 LH D-AIMB EDDF 06.jpg|thumb|right|Two Lufthansa Airbus A380s at Frankfurt Airport (2010)]]
[[File:Rodung Flughafen EDDF.jpg|thumb|Construction of the fourth runway (June 2009)]]
From 2005 to 2007 a large [[Airbus A380]] maintenance facility was built at Frankfurt Airport because Lufthansa wanted to station their future A380-aircraft-fleet here. Due to economic reasons only half of the facility has been built so far. Both terminals also underwent major renovations in order to handle the A380, including the installation of a third boarding bridge at several gates. Lufthansa's first Airbus A380 went into operation in June 2010 and was baptised ''Frankfurt am Main''.

'''The Squaire'''

In 2011 a large office building called ''The Squaire'' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''square'' and ''air'') opened at Frankfurt Airport. It was built on top of the Airport long-distance station and is considered the largest office building in Germany with {{convert|140,000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} floor area. Main tenants are [[KPMG]] and two [[Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts|Hilton Hotels]].

'''Fourth runway'''

Plans to build a fourth runway at Frankfurt Airport had been under-way since 1997 but due to the violent conflicts with the building of the third runway, Fraport let residents groups and environmentalists participate in the process to find an agreeable solution. In 2000 a task force presented their conclusion which generally approved a new runway, but in shorter length (only 2.800 metres compared to the other three 4.000 metres long runways) which would serve as a landing-only runway for smaller aircraft. Additional requirements included improved noise protection arrangements and a strict ban on night flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. across the whole airport. In 2001 Fraport applied for an approval to build a new runway, with three possible variants assessed. This concluded that a runway north-west of the airport ground would deliver the fewest adverse effects for local residents and the surrounding environment. The plans were approved by the Hessian government in December 2007, but the requested ban on night flights was lifted because it was argued that an international airport like Frankfurt would need night flights, especially for worldwide [[freight]] transport. Construction of the new 2,800 meters (9,240 feet) long ''Runway Northwest'' in the Kelsterbach Forest began in early 2009. 

The runway officially went into operation on October 20, 2011, with an aircraft carrying [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] performing the first landing on October 21. 

The centre line separation from the existing north runway is about 1,400 meters (4,620 feet). This will allow for simultaneous instrument landing system (ILS) operations on these two runways, which has not been possible on the existing parallel runways because they do not meet the 3,500 foot requirement for ILS operations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ausbau.fraport.com/cms/default/rubrik/2/2227.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This will enable the airport to increase its capacity from the current 83 to 126 aircraft movements per hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-05/air-berlin-urged-to-switch-focus-to-frankfurt-boost-oneworld-connections.html Bloomberg.com - Air Berlin Urged to Switch Focus to FRA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausbau.fraport.com/cms/default/dok/352/352869.groundbreaking_ceremony_for_frankfurt_ai.htm Groundbreaking Ceremony for Frankfurt Airport’s Runway Northwest]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Preliminary ban on night flights'''

On October 11, 2011, the Hessian Administration Court ruled that night flights are no longer allowed at Frankfurt Airport after the inauguration of the new runway, and therefore overrode the approval from the Hessian government from 2007 which allowed 17 scheduled flights per night. A definitive ruling concerning night flights at Frankfurt Airport will be made by the German Administrative Court, but not before 2012.

== Future expansions ==
[[File:Frankfurt-Main Airport Map EN.png|thumb|Airport map with planned expansions]]
With the inauguration of the fourth runway in October 2011, the airport is able to handle the predicted demand of about 700,000 aircraft movements in 2020. 

To handle the predicted passenger amount of 90 million in 2020, Fraport is currently building a new terminal section at Terminal 1. Also, a new Terminal 3 is scheduled to be built south of the existing terminals beginning in 2013.

'''Terminal 1 expansion'''

A new pier, called ''A-Plus'', is currently under construction and scheduled to open in 2012. The pier will operate flights to non-[[Schengen Area|Schengen]] destinations and will be used exclusively by [[Lufthansa]]. It will be compatible with [[Airbus A380]] operations and should increase the passenger capacity by six million.

'''Terminal 3'''
   
[[Fraport]] also plans to build a large new terminal south of the existing terminals at the ground of the former [[Rhein-Main Air Base]]. The new ''Terminal 3'' should be able to house up to 25 million passengers and will feature 75 new aircraft positions. An extension of the [[people mover]] system ''SkyLine'' is planned to transport people to Terminal 1, the airport train stations and Terminal 2.

== Terminals, airlines, and destinations ==
[[File:Flughafen Frankfurt am Main.JPG|thumb|Lufthansa [[Boeing 747]] parked at Frankfurt Airport (2004)]]
[[File:AirportFrankfurt terminal1.jpg|thumb|Terminal 1 (May 2004)]]
[[File:Frankfurt Airport Terminal 2.JPG|thumb|Terminal 2]]
Frankfurt Airport has several structures for passenger, cargo and general aviation operations.

=== Terminals ===
There are two passenger terminals at the airport: Terminal 1 is divided into concourses A, B and C and Terminal 2 is divided into concourses D and E. Lufthansa also maintains a dedicated terminal for use by their First Class passengers.

==== Terminal 1 ====
Terminal 1 opened on 14 March 1972, and was called ''Terminal Mitte'' (Central Terminal) since it was located between two runways, and between the original terminal in the east and the cargo area in the west. It was designed in a modern style for the period, with polished silver interiors and corrugated walls.

The terminal is functionally divided into three levels, the departure level in the upper deck with check-in counters, the arrival level with´baggage claim areas at ground level and, underneath, a distribution level with access to the (regional) train station and underground and multilevel parking. Departure and arrivals levels each have separate street approaches. A bus station is located at arrivals level. Parallel to the terminal, on the other side of the street, are a hotel and an office building (&quot;FAC&quot; = Frankfurt Airport Centre). The three-level underground parking garages are beneath those buildings. The tracks of the train station run between the terminal itself and the range of office and hotel buildings.

The landside of Terminal 1 is 420 meters long. Horizontally, it is divided into three areas (Concourses A, B and C).

A satellite view of Terminal 1 shows it to have 54 gates equipped with jetways (25 in Concourse A, 18 in Concourse B, 11 in Concourse C). Frankfurt Airport's official website shows a total of 103 gates (a figure which includes &quot;stand&quot; gates, which are gates with no jetways).

[[Lufthansa]] and its [[Star Alliance]] partners currently dominate Terminal 1.

==== Terminal 2 ====
Terminal 2 was opened in 1994 containing gate areas D and E.  It is to the east of Terminal 1. A continuous concourse between 1C and 2D provides direct access between the two terminals.  Terminal 2 has eight gates with jetways and 34 stands, a total of 42 gates.

==== Lufthansa First Class Terminal ====
[[Lufthansa]] has a separate First Class Terminal at Frankfurt Airport (50.049166 N,8.565856 E) for the use of its [[first class travel|first class]] passengers. The terminal can only be used by passengers flying Lufthansa First Class or Lufthansa's Miles &amp; More HON Circle members. They also must be departing on a flight operated by Air Dolomiti, Austrian Airlines Group, Lufthansa, Lufthansa Regional or SWISS. Passengers flying other Star Alliance partners in First Class do not have access to the First Class Terminal. The terminal has 200 staff and is used by about 300 passengers daily.  It provides individualised security screening and customs facilities, [[valet parking]], a white-linen restaurant, a [[cigar]] room and bubble baths. Passengers clear exit immigration controls in the terminal and then are driven from the terminal directly to their aircraft by a chaffeured [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]] or [[Porsche Panamera]]. The commercial success of the FCT at Frankfurt has led Lufthansa to plan the opening of a similar facility at [[Munich Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Bubble Bath and a Glass Of Bubbly — at the Airport,&quot; ''Wall Street Journal'', July 10, 2007.[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118402795529161584-search.html?KEYWORDS=%22first+class+terminal%27&amp;COLLECTION=wsjie/6month]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access ==
=== Public transport ===
There are two railway stations at Frankfurt Airport: one for suburban/regional trains and one for long distance trains.

[[Frankfurt Airport Regional station]] at Terminal 1 provides access to the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] commuter rail lines S8 and S9 which depart every 15 minutes during the day to [[Wiesbaden Hauptbahnhof|Wiesbaden]] in the west via [[Rüsselsheim station|Rüsselsheim]] and [[Mainz Hauptbahnhof|Mainz]] and to [[Hanau Hauptbahnhof|Hanau]] in the east via [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof|Frankfurt Central Station]], Frankfurt city centre and [[Offenbach (Main) Ost station|Offenbach am Main Ost]]. The journey time to Frankfurt Central Station is 11 minutes, to the city centre ([[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptwache station|Hauptwache]]) 15 minutes. The first S-Bahn trains arrive at 4:28h from Frankfurt and Hanau, and at 4:29h from Mainz and Wiesbaden; the last ones depart at 1:32h to Frankfurt, at 0:29h to Wiesbaden and at 0:59h to Rüsselsheim.

[[Regional-Express]] trains to other destinations like [[Saarbrücken Hauptbahnhof|Saarbrücken]] in the west, [[Koblenz Hauptbahnhof|Koblenz]] in the Rhine valley to the north, or [[Würzburg Hauptbahnhof|Würzburg]] in the east also call at the Regional Railway Station, as do some long distance trains, especially at night when the Long Distance Railway Station is closed.

[[File:Fraport Anreise modalsplit 2006.png|thumb|Modal split of means of transport of passengers departing from Frankfurt airport in 2006]]

[[Frankfurt Airport long-distance station]] was opened in 1999.  It is the end point of the newly-built [[Cologne–Frankfurt high-speed rail line]], which links southern Germany to the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] metropolitan area, the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] via [[Cologne]] at speeds up to {{convert|300|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. All [[Intercity-Express|ICE]] trains between Cologne and southern Germany stop at Frankfurt Airport, taking slightly less than an hour from Cologne. About 10 trains per hour depart in all directions.

The station is squeezed in between the A3 and the four-lane ''Bundesstraße'' B43, linked to Terminal 1 by a building that bridges the Autobahn. Railway passengers can check in right at the train station for about 60 airlines.

[[Deutsche Bahn]] operates the [[AIRail Service]] in conjunction with [[Lufthansa]], [[American Airlines]] and [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]]. The service operates to the central stations of [[Bonn Hauptbahnhof|Bonn]], [[Köln Hauptbahnhof|Cologne]], [[Düsseldorf Hauptbahnhof|Düsseldorf]], [[Freiburg Hauptbahnhof|Freiburg]], [[Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof|Karlsruhe]], [[Leipzig Hauptbahnhof|Leipzig]], [[Hamburg Hauptbahnhof|Hamburg]], [[Hannover Hauptbahnhof|Hannover]], [[Mannheim Hauptbahnhof|Mannheim]], [[München Hauptbahnhof|Munich]], [[Nürnberg Hauptbahnhof|Nuremberg]], [[Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof|Stuttgart]] and to [[Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe station|Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe]].

Various transport companies provide bus services to the airport.

=== Car and taxi ===
Frankfurt Airport is located in the [[Frankfurt City Forest]] and directly connected to an [[Autobahn]] intersection called [[Frankfurter Kreuz]] where the [[Bundesautobahn 3|A3]] and [[Bundesautobahn 5|A5]] meet. It takes a 10–15 minutes by car or taxi to get to Frankfurt Central Station or the city centre.

Passengers driving their owns cars can park in multilevel parking garages (mostly underground) along the terminals. A long term holiday parking lot is located south of the runways and connected by shuttle bus to the terminals.

=== Ground transportation statistics ===
In 2006, 29.5% of the 12,299,192 passengers whose air travel originated in Frankfurt came by private car, 27.9% came by rail, 20.4% by taxi, 11.1% parked their car at the airport for the duration of their trip, 5.3% came by bus, and 4.6% arrived with a rental car.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraport_MVG-MF_2007&quot;&gt;Statistical data prepared by Fraport department MVG-MF based on polls conducted in the departure lounges every four days&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidents and accidents ==
On 22 May 1983 during an [[Air show]] at Rhein-Main Air Base, a Canadian [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]] [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] crashed into a nearby road, hitting a car and killing all passengers, a vicar's family of five. The pilot was able to [[Ejection seat|eject]].

In 1988 the first leg of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] (a Boeing 727) took off from Frankfurt. About half of the passengers and baggage were from other flights and had changed planes to Flight 103 (a Boeing 747) at [[Heathrow Airport]] to continue to New York.
